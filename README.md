## ⚙️ Algorithm Overview
Chaotic Key Generation: Generate pseudo-random sequences using Chirikov & Chebyshev maps.

DNA Encoding: Convert image pixel values into DNA strands using predefined rules.

XOR Encryption: Perform logical XOR on encoded values using chaos-derived sequences.

Decryption: Inverse the encoding and XOR process using the same keys.
